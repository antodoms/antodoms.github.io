  <p>In the main page I listed 5 of my most valued projects. Here I am going to list some other projects that I did in the past few years.</p>
  <br>
  <h4> <a href="https://github.com/QFest/qfest-event-manager" rel="nofollow">Qfest Event Manager </a></h4>
  <p>This is an event management software basically for managing Registrations for an event such as a College Technical Fest or as inter-School Competition registration. Please check the Wiki pages to know more details about this project.</p>

  <h4> <a href="https://github.com/antodoms/listing-sales-stripe" rel="nofollow">Listing sales </a></h4>
  <p>This is still work on progress project. Which i made to learn ruby on rails. Here I have used scaffolding, Devise to manage users, Stripe as a payment gateway, AWS to store the listing images and bootstrap 3 for styling. </p>

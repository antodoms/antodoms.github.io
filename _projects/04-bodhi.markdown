description: |
  <p>Viswajyothi College Of Engineering (VJCET) conducts a national level Tech fest every year. I was honoured to build the tech fest website along with 2 of my close friends for the Bodhi Techfest 2013. You can see the <a href="http://ieeevjcet.org/2013/" rel="nofollow">Bodhi Techfest demo website</a> that we created from the link. </p>
  <br>
  <p>We used HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Jquery, Ajax and php to build the site.</p>

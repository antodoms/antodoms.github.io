title: Coverbooth - Website featuring Facebook Covers

  <p>Coverbooth was one of the most viral product by us. Though being one of the first Facebook cover website made after Facebook Timeline was introduced, Coverbooth grew very fast and we decided to sell it off to someone so that we concentrate on other projects. <a href="https://flippa.com/2764896-facebook-covers-site-with-670-169-pageviews-mo-making-508-mo-via-adsense" rel="nofollow">Coverbooth was sold for $9050 in flippa</a>.</p>
  <br>
  <p> I was incharge of SEO, marketing, increasing social presence and sales of the website. Coverbooth was developed using CodeIgniter PHP framework.</p>

title: Techomag - 5 year old tech blog
description: |
  <p>I started this blog in september 2009 in my 12th grade with a Friend of mine. I used to feature articles mainly on security, bypass , hacking, social media and SEO. This November 2014, I sold this website to an Australian SEO Company for $3000 as I was not getting time to mantain it. You Can see <a href="https://flippa.com/2764897-5-year-old-pr-3-site-with-11-568-uniques-mo-making-186-mo" rel="nofollow">techomag sales history in flippa.</a></p>
  <br>
  <p>I was involved in overall management of the website. I created a wordpress Child theme for techomag using PHP, Ajax and twitter-bootsrap 3.In the begining I used to write articles myself , but later when i started earning money from the blog i hired writers and started concentrating on other projects.</p>

description: |
  <p>This was my main project for my Btech in Electronics & Communication Engineering. Beagle-copter is a Quadcopter project in c++ using Beaglebone black (BBB) as a Flight controller. Check out the code <a href="https://github.com/antodoms/beagle-copter">Beagle Copter Github repository</a> here.</p>
  <br>
  <p>This is one of those projects that I am really proud of where I have spend a lot of time in learning & executing. Beagle Copter is a flight controller program for linux based systems running on ARM processors. Here I learned in and out of Linux kernel 3.8.13 and my main working distro for development was Angstrom OS. I also had to learn ARM processors Assembly Language or PRU programming to get real-time inputs from 6 Channel reciever and send real-time outputs to ESC's.You can check out my Final <a href="http://antodominic.com/beagle-copter/" rel="follow">presentation for beagle Copter Project</a> here.</p>
